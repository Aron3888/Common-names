# Common-names
Eight friends met at a party; their ages in whole numbers of years were all different. They were Alan, Cary, James, Lucy, Nick, Ricky, Steve and Victor, with Lucy being the youngest. 

For each of them, the square of their age was a three-figure number consisting of three different digits. Furthermore, for any two of them, the squares of their ages had at least one digit in common precisely when their names had a least one letter in common.

### In alphabetical order of their names, what are the eight ages?
The answer given by the newspaper was 19, 31, 29, 16, 25, 23, 28 and 27. 

## Haskell programming
I used Haskell language to solve the common names problem and printed out [(19,31,29,16,25,23,28,27)]. Three testers ensure that your code can run correctly.
